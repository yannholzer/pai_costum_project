costum project for the PAI class.

The project idea is to predict characteristic of planetary systems based on the original characteristic of the disk that formed the system.

The dataset is the result of simulation of disk to planetary system formations.
The first model will be a typical neural network.

The first task will be simply predict global planetary properties from the disk, such as the sum of the mass, the number of planets, maybe the number of types of planets (hot jupiter, rocky planet), maybe binary classification such as present or not ?
